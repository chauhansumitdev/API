representational state transfer (rest)
defines the guidelines how the client and server sent the data at particular state .
representational - state of the resource is represented in a format that can be understood by the clients.

guidelines of rest -
client server 
cachable - data sent by the server need to be cachable by the ui
layered - atomic transactions like one transaction need to know about the current task no matter what the server is doing things related to other stuffs
stateless - the server servers the request equally form any device does not save the state who requested for the response
exception for being stateless is authorisation and authentication
uniform interface-


URI -> uniform resource identifier. string of characters that  identify a particular resource.
two types - URL, URN
url- access resource directly over a protocol
urn - uniform resource name - it gives the name of the resource rather than how to access the resource

path parameters - :3 <- paticualar path for the resource
query parameters - limit the amount of response of the particular query - ?liit=...so on in the uri

rest is implementd over https using methods

heaers - metadata about the req./res.
